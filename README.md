# ROS2_learning
A comprehensive learning repository for ROS2 C++ (ROScpp) development.

## Repository Structure (仓库结构)

This repository is organized into progressive learning modules, each focusing on specific aspects of ROS2 C++ development:

### Learning Modules (学习模块)

|--------|-------|-------------|
| `01_basic_concepts` | 基础概念 | ROS2 architecture, nodes, basic programming patterns |
| `02_publishers_subscribers` | 发布者和订阅者 | Topic-based communication, message types, QoS |
| `03_services` | 服务 | Request-response communication patterns |
| `04_actions` | 动作 | Long-running tasks with feedback |
| `05_parameters` | 参数 | Node configuration and dynamic reconfiguration |
| `06_launch_files` | 启动文件 | System orchestration and multi-node launching |
| `07_custom_msgs_srvs` | 自定义消息和服务 | Creating custom interfaces |
| `08_lifecycle_nodes` | 生命周期节点 | Managed node states and system composition |
| `09_time_timers` | 时间和定时器 | Time handling and periodic operations |
| `10_logging` | 日志记录 | Debugging and system monitoring |
| `11_tf2_transforms` | 坐标变换 | Coordinate transformations and spatial relationships |
| `12_utilities_tools` | 实用工具 | Testing, debugging, and performance tools |

### Examples (示例项目)
The `examples/` directory contains complete projects that demonstrate the integration of multiple concepts from the learning modules.

## Getting Started (开始学习)

1. Start with `01_basic_concepts` to understand ROS2 fundamentals
2. Progress through modules sequentially for structured learning
3. Each module contains:
   - README with learning objectives
   - Code examples and templates
   - Hands-on exercises
4. Complete example projects to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites (前置要求)
- ROS2 (Humble/Iron/Rolling)
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- CMake 3.8+
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

## Usage (使用方法)
Each module is self-contained with its own README and examples. Navigate to any module directory to begin learning that specific topic.
